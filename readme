# EBOLA_UTRS_Prediction_Alignement_probing1M7-NMIA
This repository contains the data and python code files used to predict the Ebola-UTRS secondary structure. 
This version is compatible with ViennaRNA-2.3.1, be sure the used version is above. 
VArna version VARNAv3-93.jar should be added to the working repository. http://varna.lri.fr/index.php?lang=en&page=downloads&css=varna 

# To launch the program
RNAstruct.Config => for parameters configuration
python2.7  Rnastruct.py

#Input:
Alignement => does contain MSA data used for this analysis. 
fasta_files => RNA sequences
fasta_Shape => SHAPE data with a specific extension.

#Output: 
OutputSamples1000 => structure samples used for the analysis
Multiprobing => suggested centroids from RNAMPSP treatement.


# Varna was furtherly used to modele structures with 1M7 data, results are stored in 'RNAMPSP_output_EBOLA'
# Rchie, http://www.e-rna.org/r-chie/, was also used to assess the covariation in the MSA for the proposed strctures, results could be fount at 'PDF' folder.
